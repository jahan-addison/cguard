# fcrownguard

A relational database in modern C++

## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./main
> make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```

## Services

If the repository is activated with Travis-CI, then unit tests will be built and executed on each commit.
The same is true if the repository is activated with Appveyor.

If the repository is activated with Coveralls/Codecov, then deployment to Travis will also calculate code coverage and
upload this to Coveralls.io and/or Codecov.io
